# Business-Forecasting
Business forecasting is critical for retailers since it is necessary for a variety of operational choices. Forecasting demand on special days, when demand patterns are very different from those on typical days, is one of the biggest challenges. We discuss the issue of predict-ing the daily demand for various product categories at the shop level using the example of a supermarket chain. These projections serve as a guide for purchasing and manufacturing decisions. We address the forecasting issue using machine learning. We describe and talk about the potential of creating a classification problem rather than a regression problem in specific. Machine learning techniques outperform traditional methods empirically, whereas classification-based approaches outperform regression-based approaches. We also discov-ered that machine learning techniques are better suited for use in a sizeable demand fore-casting scenario that frequently happens in the retail sector, in addition to offering more accurate forecasts.
